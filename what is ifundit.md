##Campaign Modes

ifundIT campaigns fit into two overarching modes: “Fund2Goal,” in which projects must raise funds up to a set goal in order to enter development, and “TopX,” in which projects compete to earn funds and “place” in the top ranking for further development.

Each of these campaign modes is highly configurable – you can adjust the timeline, funding goals, participant models, and campaign limiters in accordance with your organization’s objectives and characteristics. However, each mode has its own benefits and challenges that make them suited for different campaigns.

Below you will find more detailed explanations of each of the two campaign modes – when considering which campaign will be best for your organization, look to “Benefits of Enterprise Crowdfunding” (LINK HERE??)

###Fund2Goal

The Fund2Goal mode is the closer of the two to a “traditional” crowdfunding model. In a Fund2Goal campaign, innovators submit projects for investors to invest in, with a funding goal that is typically equivalent to the cost of developing the project, usually as a Proof of Concept. Investors are given a set amount of funds to invest in projects they feel passionate about, and the campaign ends once either the planned budget has been allocated to funded projects or a set deadline has been reached.

The budget of a Fund2Goal campaign is tied to the capital needed to develop successful projects. As such, the number of investors and the funds allocated to each investor need to be regulated. However, the correlation between “ifundIT money” and real development capital allows the CMO to control the rate at which projects are funded, and keep the campaign on schedule.

###TopX

The TopX mode is less dependent on the real-world capital set aside for the campaign, which makes it more flexible for experimental use cases. In a TopX campaign, innovators submit projects for an unlimited number of potential investors, each of which has been given an amount of virtual funds. Rather than trying to reach a specific set funding goal, innovators compete against each other to rank within the top bracket predetermined by the Campaign Owner.

The budget of a TopX campaign has no impact on the amount of money given to each investor, which allows very large campaigns regardless of how much capital each funded project receives. In effect, this mode grants nearly unlimited flexibility to the CMO, with the only major constraint being the duration of the campaign.
