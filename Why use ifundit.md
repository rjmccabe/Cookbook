# ifundIT Success Stories

The ifundIT program has helped IBM boost employee engagement, drive cultural transformation, and disrupt conventional corporate decision-making. It’s also generated some incredible projects that have resulted in new apps, services, and policies that continue to grow and make an impact at IBM. 

Here we’ve highlighted some of the most successful projects that have come out of ifundIT campaigns. They represent quite a diverse slice of the total funded projects, but they all share a defining trait: the support of the crowd enabled them to overcome obstacles that would have prevented them from being adopted in a conventional business funding model.

We hope that these examples will give you some insight into both the power of ifundIT to generate solutions as well as the variety of forms those solutions can take.

## ACE: Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation

ACE, which stands for Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation, is an internal feedback and evaluation platform that sits at the heart of IBM’s recent Agile transformation. It allows IBMers to solicit from and provide feedback to managers, teammates, and colleagues at the touch of a button. Envisioned as part of IBM's global updated performance review process, ACE encourages an Agile process of continual self-reflection and improvement.

ACE began its relationship with ifundIT in 2015, during the Spring into Bluemix campaign. Since ACE was already available as a web app, the ACE team submitted a project for a mobile app they had been working on. Their project was funded through ifundIT, and as a result completed development of the app. Now, the entire platform – web and mobile app together – are part of IBM’s global strategy for its review system.

## Call In

Call In is a mobile app that takes IBMers from calendar invite to conference call in seconds. The app syncs with the native calendar app on iOS and IBM Verse or IBM Traveler on Android to allow users to join conference calls on their mobile phones directly from a meeting invite or calendar event.

Call In came into the 2014 Mobile ifundIT campaign with an existing and functional mobile app, so their project focused on using the funds from their project to incorporate new features such as One Touch, context information, and Blue Pages participant links.


## Global Extended Teams

Global Extended Teams is a web tool for creating and viewing true functional reporting chains between employees, and showing extended teams across borders. It allows users to add and modify relationships between “Functional Managers” and “Functional Reportees” across the globe in order to facilitate work assignments and increased performance, while local managers handle legal and HR relationships in the employee’s country.

Global Extended Teams was initially developed as a proof of concept, but unfortunately did not receive any funding to progress into a true pilot phase. The team submitted a project during the 2012 ifundIT campaign, and its success there gave them the funding they needed to develop the platform for use. The resulting tool was so popular that it was integrated into IBM BluePages.

## ParkUp

ParkUp is an unconventional but extremely innovative mobile app that was developed by IBMers in Madrid facing a universal problem: finding parking. The IBM office in Madrid has reserved parking spots in a designated lot, but the lot frequently had spots go unused as employees traveled for business, vacation, or worked from home. To solve this problem, ParkUp provides users the ability to list their spots for others when they know they won’t need them, allowing their colleagues to “book” them, maximizing parking potential and saving everyone time and money.

The ParkUp team took their idea to the 2014 Mobile ifundIT campaign, and met with resounding success. Following its implementation in Madrid, ParkUp won a Client Value Outstanding Technical Achievement Award in 2015. Since then, the app has gone viral, and has been adopted in Warsaw, Poland, with expansion in the works for the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. 

## Global Maps

IBM Global Maps is one in a collection of three separate platforms called Map2Meetings, together with Mobile Site Serv/ Room Finder and Smart Conference Reservation & Facilities Management. Global Maps in particular aims to help IBMers who travel to unfamiliar offices find the location of the office and navigate to their meeting room.

Each of the three components of Map2Meetings got its start during the 2014 Mobile campaign, and joined together during development. The unified platform has seen niche usage in Brazil, however, Global Maps has a mobile app called IBM Maps that is available globally.

## Tech Support for Clients

Tech Support for Clients is a mobile app that lets IBM customers access technical support content and functions for all of their IBM products. It serves as a hub for viewing support documentation, customer support plans, warranty information, and if needed, for contacting IBM customer service representatives with geo-location assistance and click-to-call.

Tech Support for Clients was an original project submitted during the 2014 Mobile ifundIT campaign. It is externally available for both iOS and Android, and is a fully-featured client-facing solution in CIO’s Technical Support strategy.
