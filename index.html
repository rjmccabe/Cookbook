<p>link to <a href="what.md">What is ifundIT</a></p>

<p>One of the reasons IBM has had so much success with ifundIT is its ability to foster focused innovation in specific areas. Enterprise crowdfunding produces immediate benefits by harnessing the untapped power of the crowd – but it a powerful tool to amplify your organization’s strategic goals.</p>

<p>For example, in the 2015 “Spring into Bluemix” campaign, all submitted projects were required to run on IBM Bluemix, IBM’s cloud-based mobile and web app development platform. In addition to over 50 successfully funded projects, the ifundIT campaign resulted in 770 new Bluemix users, helping IBM achieve its goal of one million subscribers by the end of the year.</p>

<p>As your team begins to outline your first campaign, think carefully about its focus. Consider your organization’s long term objectives – things like new development tools, educational initiatives, or any other strategic goals – and think about how you might be able to incorporate them into your campaign. For example, the focus of IBM’s “Cognitive Build” campaign was on "Cognitive": a key pillar of IBM's strategy. To that end, project submissions were required to incorporate Watson APIs, but also encouraged Agile and Design Thinking methodologies throughout the process. Cognitive Build not only resulted in concrete innovation with Watson, but also a company-wide introduction to Cognitive, giving everyone in the organization a deeper understanding of the concept.</p>

<a id="selecting-your-team" class="anchor" href="#selecting-your-team" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Selecting your Team</h2>

<p>Running a crowdfunding campaign requires a serious investment of time and energy, and a passionate and committed team to make sure it is successful. The ifundIT team has both facilitated and actively managed a number of successful campaigns within IBM – while we’ve advised other organizations on running their own campaigns, we’ve also run some of the biggest ones ourselves. Based on this experience, we’ve distilled the responsibilities and requirements of managing an ifundIT campaign into four key roles, broken down below. All together, they make up the Project Management Office (PMO).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that these roles are the roles we used within our own company, and as such may not reflect the goal or necessities of your organization. Feel free to adapt, combine, or subdivide these roles to match the scope and budget of your campaign. While each role is relatively distinct, there’s also plenty of room for overlap!</p>

<h3>
<a id="campaign-owner" class="anchor" href="#campaign-owner" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Campaign Owner</h3>

<p>The Campaign Owner typically makes the decision to run an ifundIT crowdfunding campaign in their business. They define the campaign focus and desired outcome, set the budget requirements, and develop the campaign timeline. In addition, the Campaign Owner coordinates between the Campaign Administrator(s) and the Community Manager to set the overall campaign strategy.</p>

<p>The Campaign Owner’s responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting the campaign’s budget</li>
<li>Choosing a focus for the campaign</li>
<li>Allocating personnel and capital</li>
<li>Determining the campaign’s audience</li>
<li>Choosing a campaign mode</li>
<li>Developing a timeline for the campaign</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="campaign-administrators" class="anchor" href="#campaign-administrators" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Campaign Administrator(s)</h3>

<p>The Campaign Administrator(s) manages the many logistical and day-to-day requirements of the campaign, including the triage process for new project submissions, as well as the specifics of configuring the ifundIT tool for their organization. They also construct and appoint the Vetting Board, which is responsible for evaluating the feasibility of each submitted project.</p>

<p>The Campaign Administrator’s responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Configuring the ifundIT tool for their organization</li>
<li>Interfacing with the IBM team for any consulting or needed support</li>
<li>Determining and collecting the metrics they need</li>
<li>Establishing the investor model</li>
<li>Appointing the members of the Vetting Board</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In our experience managing previous campaigns, we've found that many organizations combine the roles of Campaign Owner and Campaign Administrator and designate a single individual to fulfill the responsibilities of both. While this approach can be effective for smaller campaigns, we recommend keeping the roles separate for campaigns that run longer than 6 weeks or have an audience of more than 10,000 people.</p>

<h3>
<a id="vetting-board-members" class="anchor" href="#vetting-board-members" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vetting Board Members</h3>

<p>The Members of the Vetting Board are Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who perform a lightweight evaluation to determine the feasibility and viability of each new project. The Vetting Board ensures that project submissions are novel, compliant with any business or campaign guidelines, and realistic within the established scope and scale of the campaign. Vetting Board Members do not rate projects based on their content or marketability, or decide if they are good or bad (That's the crowd's decision!) – rather, they are intended to streamline the flow of innovation and maximize the quantity of deliverable projects.</p>

<p>The Vetting Board Member’s responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing subject matter expertise to new project owners</li>
<li>Ensuring that each project is compliant with campaign guidelines and organizational policies</li>
<li>Participating in reviews of project submissions on a regular basis</li>
<li>Giving comments and ongoing feedback to project owners</li>
<li>Identifying non-compliant projects for review by the Campaign Administrator(s)</li>
<li>Facilitating a pipeline of healthy ideas during the campaign</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="community-manager" class="anchor" href="#community-manager" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Community Manager</h3>

<p>The Community Manager is responsible for developing the communication strategy for the entire campaign, and for leading the initiative to inform and promote the campaign with the organization’s intended audience. They design any personalized content for the organization’s instance of ifundIT, ranging from automated system messages to FAQs to landing page greetings. The Community Manager also manages the social aspects of the campaign and its participants, in the form of any online communities associated with the campaign.</p>

<p>The Community Manager’s responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing specialized user interface content for the ifundIT tool</li>
<li>Developing the overall communication strategy for the campaign</li>
<li>Promoting the campaign throughout the organization</li>
<li>Managing online communities related to the campaign</li>
</ul>
