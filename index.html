<div class="editable"><p>Starting Your Campaign&nbsp;</p><p>Defining your Focus and Outcome&nbsp;</p><p>One of the reasons IBM has had so much success with ifundIT is its ability to foster focused innovation in specific areas. Enterprise crowdfunding produces immediate benefits by harnessing the untapped power of the crowd &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also a powerful tool to amplify your organization&rsquo;s strategic goals.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in the 2015 &ldquo;Spring into Bluemix&rdquo; campaign, all submitted projects were required to run on IBM Bluemix, IBM&rsquo;s cloud-based mobile and web app development platform. In addition to over 50 successfully funded projects, the ifundIT campaign increased awareness of Bluemix in the external Top Coder community which IBM was using to help in building some of the projects. The campaign resulted in 770 new Bluemix users, helping IBM achieve its goal of one million subscribers by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>As your team begins to outline your first campaign, think carefully about its focus, and your desired outcome. Consider your organization&rsquo;s long term objectives &ndash; things like new development tools, educational initiatives, or any other strategic goals &ndash; and think about how you might be able to incorporate them into your campaign. For example, the focus of IBM&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cognitive Build&rdquo; campaign was on "Cognitive": a key pillar of IBM's strategy. To that end, project submissions were required to incorporate Watson APIs, but also encouraged Agile and Design Thinking methodologies throughout the process. Cognitive Build not only resulted in concrete innovation with Watson, but also a company-wide introduction to Cognitive, giving everyone in the organization a deeper understanding of the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>Building your Team&nbsp;</p><p>Running a crowdfunding campaign requires a serious investment of time and energy, and a passionate and committed team to make sure it is successful. The ifundIT team has both facilitated and actively managed a number of successful campaigns within IBM &ndash; while we&rsquo;ve advised other organizations on running their own campaigns, we&rsquo;ve also run some of the biggest ones ourselves. Based on this experience, we&rsquo;ve distilled the responsibilities and requirements of managing an ifundIT campaign into four key roles, broken down below. All together, they make up the Campaign Management Office (CMO).&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that these roles are the roles we used within our own company, and as such may not reflect the goal or necessities of your organization. Feel free to adapt, combine, or subdivide these roles to match the scope and budget of your campaign. While each role is relatively distinct, there&rsquo;s also plenty of room for overlap!&nbsp;</p><p>Campaign Owner&nbsp;</p><p>The Campaign Owner typically makes the decision to run an ifundIT crowdfunding campaign in their business. They define the campaign focus and desired outcome, set the budget requirements, and develop the campaign timeline. In addition, the Campaign Owner coordinates between the Campaign Administrator(s) and the Community Manager to set the overall campaign strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Campaign Owner&rsquo;s responsibilities include:&nbsp;</p><p>Setting the campaign&rsquo;s budget&nbsp;</p><p>Choosing a focus for the campaign&nbsp;</p><p>Allocating personnel and capital&nbsp;</p><p>Determining the campaign&rsquo;s audience&nbsp;</p><p>Choosing a campaign mode&nbsp;</p><p>Developing a timeline for the campaign&nbsp;</p><p>Campaign Administrator(s)&nbsp;</p><p>The Campaign Administrator(s) manages the many logistical and day-to-day requirements of the campaign, including the triage process for new project submissions, as well as the specifics of configuring the ifundIT tool for their organization. They also construct and appoint the Review Board, which is responsible for evaluating the feasibility of each submitted project.&nbsp;</p><p>The Campaign Administrator&rsquo;s responsibilities include:&nbsp;</p><p>Configuring the ifundIT tool for their organization&nbsp;</p><p>Interfacing with the IBM team for any consulting or needed support&nbsp;</p><p>Determining and collecting the metrics they need&nbsp;</p><p>Establishing the investor model&nbsp;</p><p>Appointing the members of the Review Board&nbsp;</p><p>In our experience managing previous campaigns, we've found that many organizations combine the roles of Campaign Owner and Campaign Administrator and designate a single individual to fulfill the responsibilities of both. While this approach can be effective for smaller campaigns, we recommend keeping the roles separate for campaigns that run longer than 6 weeks or have an audience of more than 10,000 people.&nbsp;</p><p>Review Board Members&nbsp;</p><p>The Members of the Review Board are Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who perform a lightweight evaluation to determine the viability of each new project. The Review Board ensures that project submissions do not duplicate existing work, are compliant with any business or campaign guidelines, and are feasible within the established scope and scale of the campaign. Review Board Members do not rate projects based on their content or marketability, or decide if they are good or bad (that&rsquo;s the crowd&rsquo;s decision!) &ndash; rather, they are intended to streamline the flow of innovation and maximize the quantity of deliverable projects.&nbsp;</p><p>The Review Board Member&rsquo;s responsibilities include:&nbsp;</p><p>Providing subject matter expertise to new project owners&nbsp;</p><p>Ensuring that each project is compliant with campaign guidelines and organizational policies&nbsp;</p><p>Participating in reviews of project submissions on a regular basis&nbsp;</p><p>Giving comments and ongoing feedback to project owners&nbsp;</p><p>Identifying non-compliant projects for review by the Campaign Administrator(s)&nbsp;</p><p>Facilitating a pipeline of healthy ideas&nbsp;</p><p>Community Manager&nbsp;</p><p>The Community Manager is responsible for developing the communication strategy for the entire campaign, and for leading the initiative to inform and promote the campaign with the organization&rsquo;s intended audience. They design any personalized content for the organization&rsquo;s instance of ifundIT, ranging from automated system messages to FAQs to landing page greetings. The Community Manager also manages the social aspects of the campaign and its participants, in the form of any online communities associated with the campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>The Community Manager&rsquo;s responsibilities include:&nbsp;</p><p>Designing specialized user interface content for the ifundIT tool&nbsp;</p><p>Developing the overall communication strategy for the campaign&nbsp;</p><p>Promoting the campaign throughout the organization&nbsp;</p><p>Managing online communities related to the campaign&nbsp;</p><p>Allocating your Budget&nbsp;</p><p>Every ifundIT campaign needs a predetermined budget of funds to fuel the crowdfunding investment of projects and to support them as they enter development or implementation. You must take into account not only how many funded projects you want at the end of the campaign, but also how many investors can participate, and how much each investor will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>As you make decisions about allocating a budget for your organization&rsquo;s campaign, you&rsquo;ll need to consider a few key elements.&nbsp;</p><p>How many projects are you expecting to build?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In our experience running previous campaigns, 10-15% of submitted projects are funded. While this rate is more explicit in a Fund2Goal campaign, it&rsquo;s still helpful to set the &ldquo;X&rdquo; in a TopX campaign with that in mind. Consider aiming for 5-20 funded projects for your first pilot campaign, to set a manageable scale for project submissions while your organization becomes familiar with ifundIT.&nbsp;</p><p>How much will each project cost to build and support?&nbsp;</p><p>The average project cost will vary heavily depending on your expected outcomes, so you should consider the financial commitment you can make to each funded project carefully when allocating your budget. If you&rsquo;re only interested in proof of concept applications of each project, as was the case in the Spring into Bluemix campaign, then this cost might be relatively low. On the other hand, if you are looking for complete, client-facing apps or services, you&rsquo;ll understandably need to make room for the increased production time in your budget.&nbsp;</p><p>For Fund2Goal campaigns, assume only 50% of the investor budget goes to funded projects&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most important differences between public and enterprise crowdfunding is the fact that investors are bringing the company&rsquo;s money into a project, not their own. Because all of the funding available to be invested has to be allocated by the CMO beforehand, you need to account for the fact that some investors won&rsquo;t spend all or any of their money. In order to ensure that there&rsquo;s enough funding to go around to get the desired number of successful projects, assume that only half of the total amount you give to investors will be put towards projects. As a result, we recommend doubling your total investment budget to determine how much you put out to the investor community.&nbsp;</p><p>Selecting your Audience&nbsp;</p><p>Choosing a Campaign Mode&nbsp;</p><p>When deciding which campaign mode is the best fit for your organization, consider how much marketplace control you want your CMO to exert over the course of the campaign. Also think about the outcomes you envision for your funded projects: are you looking for many, more modest ideas, or a handful of well-developed complex ones? Do you want to prioritize employee engagement and idea vetting over concrete deliverable innovation? Do you want innovators to collaborate and work together to refine their projects, or have them compete against one another for the most investor support?&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that these campaign modes are a product of our experiences with ifundIT, and represent formulations based on continued iteration of our practices and strategies. Your CMO can and should think about adjusting whichever mode you choose to better fit your needs, or even taking elements from each one to create your own.&nbsp;</p><p>Fund2Goal campaigns have historically had a greater degree of control resting on the CMO to regulate both the idea marketplace as well as the total funding pool. They also traditionally have a direct relationship between the funding a project earns during the investing phase and the cost of building it &ndash; in other words, investors have direct control over &ldquo;real money&rdquo; that will actually go to projects they support. This particular aspect makes Fund2Goal campaigns good for fostering employee engagement and disrupting the traditional decision making process regarding spending in the business world.&nbsp;</p><p>Fund2Goal gives you:&nbsp;</p><p>Control over the marketplace&nbsp;</p><p>Investment that shows &ldquo;real&rdquo; funding allocation&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom-up decision making&nbsp;</p><p>TopX campaigns typically require little to no marketplace management, since the budget for funding projects is not directly tied to the funds given to investors. In other words, there is no differentiation in need between projects in a TopX campaign, therefore, there&rsquo;s no need to regulate funding during the campaign. Because of this, TopX campaigns work best when you want the dollar amount on each funded project to be an indicator of investor support rather than a real dollar amount.&nbsp;</p><p>TopX gives you:&nbsp;</p><p>No differentiation in need between projects&nbsp;</p><p>Investment that shows investor support, not a real dollar amount&nbsp;</p><p>Crowd ranking of projects&nbsp;</p><p>Planning a Timeline&nbsp;</p><p>Setting Requirements&nbsp;</p><p>After running several ifundIT campaigns across our entire organization, we&rsquo;ve learned that communicating a clear set of requirements to both innovators and investors is essential to ensure that all stakeholders get what they want out of the campaign. Below, you will find the most recent iteration of our requirements for campaign participants, as well as some information about the experiences that led to their creation.&nbsp;</p><p>Requirements for Innovators&nbsp;</p><p>We found varying levels of commitment from innovators during our first IBM wide campaign in 2014. Some innovators were extremely committed to sticking with their ideas from submission to user deployment, but many were not. We found that some people got their ideas funded and then expected us to take over development. Others participated during the development process, but would not be responsive when we asked them to take actions, such as reviewing designs or code. Our team ended up having to make decisions or take actions on behalf of the innovator because they weren&rsquo;t engaged and were holding up development and other projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our experience, we created the following requirements for the Spring into Bluemix campaign in 2015:&nbsp;</p><p>Commit to the project implementation schedule, and promptly communicate schedule limitations or conflicts&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Be responsive and respect deadlines by answering questions, reviewing designs, and testing builds when expected&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Post project updates for your investors, followers, and volunteers on a regular basis&nbsp;</p><p>Own your project and stay with it through the entire lifecycle. If you are unable to stay with the project, it is your responsibility to find someone to take on the work&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Promote your completed project to the community&nbsp;</p><p>If you do not comply with these requirements during the life cycle of your project, you will lose your funding.&nbsp;</p><p>Requirements for Investors&nbsp;</p><p>During the first campaign, it was easy to get enough people to support your idea and get it funded quickly. But, was the crowd funding the &ldquo;right&rdquo; ideas for the business? We saw too many investors putting money down and then walking away, not asking where the apps were that they funded with company money. We wanted to make sure people understood this was real money and that people should be thoughtful in spending. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our experience, we created the following investor requirements for the Spring into Bluemix campaign in 2015:&nbsp;</p><p>Invest in the projects that will really make a difference to your colleagues and the company&nbsp;</p><p>Drive the consensus among the investor community on whether the app is a good idea or not&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Treat the money as if it were your own. Ask yourself: &ldquo;would I really put real money down on that app to get built? Would it make a difference to me as an investor?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Spread your funding between multiple projects, and if you don&rsquo;t find projects that are worth investing in, don&rsquo;t spend the money&nbsp;</p><p>Question the innovator. If you&rsquo;re not sure what value a project will bring, ask them for more information on how this will benefit the company&nbsp;</p><p>Follow up with the innovator for status updates if their project gets funded. Ask them if you see early designs, how their schedule&rsquo;s looking, show personal interest in their project &ndash; you gave them your investment, after all! You&rsquo;re putting real money down, which makes you a stakeholder in their project&rsquo;s success&nbsp;</p><p>Spread the Word&nbsp;</p><p>Wrapping Up&nbsp;</p><p>What happens after the campaign ends? Can export metrics &ndash; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget to export your data to continue to get value out of your campaign after it ends&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Think about outcomes &ndash; different orgs have different goals, and thus different pathways&nbsp;</p><p>Helpful Materials&nbsp;</p><p>Incorporate research on successful projects from John&nbsp;</p><p>- De- incentivize short campaigns, give investors time to decide - "we know best!"&nbsp;</p></div>
