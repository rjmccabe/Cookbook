It shifts the decision making power from the top down to the employees themselves - at all levels.</p><h2>Enterprise Crowdfunding: An Overview</h2><p>Crowdfunding is growing fast &ndash; but can it be used inside to drive innovation in a Fortune 500 company? Can it replace traditional top-down decision-making with a grassroots movement that allows employees to collaborate on funding breakthrough ideas? The answer is yes, it can!</p><p>In general, traditional public crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo are based on a simplified version of venture capital: individuals submit their ideas in the form of project pages on a website, offering a cohesive picture of what they want to create, and ask for funding to build it into reality. Other users can then back projects with their own money, with the expectation that they will receive rewards if the project is funded and developed.</p><p>Enterprise crowdfunding takes this model and combines it with the funding power of a large corporation. In enterprise crowdfunding, ideas are submitted in much the same way &ndash; but rather than private individuals investing their own money, employees are granted a portion of the enterprise&rsquo;s capital to pledge towards projects they feel will have an impact. When a project gets enough funding, the innovator doesn&rsquo;t have to go it alone: they can count on their organization to support them as they make their idea a reality. In essence, everyone benefits &ndash; innovators get to see their ideas come to life, investors get to make business-critical decisions that will impact the way they work, and the enterprise comes away with meaningful solutions and engaged employees.</p><h2>Enterprise Crowdfunding at IBM</h2><p>Before ifundIT, the CIO organization held 2-3 campaigns for its Innovation Fund each year. Employees voted on projects proposed by their colleagues, and a select board of technical leaders evaluated each submission, voted, and chose which projects to fund. 28 projects were funded using this top-down method that had little social influence.</p><p>In 2013, CIO worked with IBM Research to trial a new way to make decisions for its Innovation Fund and adapted their "1x5" project on internal crowd funding. Rebranded as IBM ifundIT, CIO embraced the concept of an open, social fundraising model to spark innovation and collaboration by employees. Based on the success of the trials, ifundIT was expanded throughout IBM over the following years, iterating on and refining the platform as time went on.</p><h3>Mobile Campaign</h3><p>IBM&rsquo;s first company-wide ifundIT campaign took place in 2014, simply termed the &ldquo;Mobile Campaign.&rdquo; It was composed of two phases, both of which were focused on increasing innovation within IBM for mobile platforms, as part of the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;MobileFirst&rdquo; initiative. Over 20,000 IBMers participated between both phases, with over 1500 ideas submitted. This campaign was the closest to the traditional model used in public crowdfunding, and the first and second phases were similar from a campaign perspective. Most of the changes that occurred focused on the user experience, as a number of improvements were made to the workflow and new features added to the tool. </p><p>The key elements of this campaign were:</p><ul><li>Theme: all submitted projects had to be mobile applications</li><li>Innovators set their own funding goals, between $10,000-$250,000</li><li>Projects were submitted throughout the campaign, and had 30 days to raise funds</li><li>There were 2000 investors, with $2000 awarded per investor</li><li>Each investor could contribute a maximum of $1000, or half their allowance, to a single project</li><li>&ldquo;Active&rdquo; investors received $1000 of &ldquo;bonus funds&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Focusing the campaign on a theme helped us get project ideas that were feasible</li></ul><ul><li>Investor allowance of $2000 seemed to be the appropriate amount per person</li><li>Guidelines helped innovators make educated guesses for funding targets</li></ul><h3>Spring into Bluemix</h3><p>The second IBM-wide ifundIT campaign took place during the spring of 2015, and focused on increasing the awareness and adoption of IBM Bluemix, IBM&rsquo;s cloud-based development platform. It was appropriately called &ldquo;Spring into Bluemix.&rdquo; Due to its narrower focus, this campaign was smaller than the Mobile campaign, with 2700 IBMers submitting over 500 ideas. Spring into Bluemix iterated on the model used during the Mobile campaign, with one of the biggest changes being a shift to a fixed funding goal for all projects.</p><p>The key elements of this campaign were:</p><ul><li>Theme: all submitted projects had to run on IBM Bluemix, whether on mobile or desktop</li><li>Each project had the same fixed funding goal &ndash; everyone needed to raise $30,000</li><li>Projects were submitted throughout the campaign, and had 30 days to raise funds</li><li>There were 2000 investors, with $2000 awarded per investor</li><li>Each investor could contribute a maximum of $500, or a quarter of their allowance, to a single project</li><li>Bonus funds were not offered due to a large investor waiting list</li></ul><p>Key takeaways:</p><ul><li>The pre-determined funding goal helped innovators scope and size an achievable project idea, making project proposals easier to review for feasibility, and funded projects were quick to get off the ground</li><li>Projects needing a minimum of 60 investors to get fully funded meant the &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; really needed to support an idea</li><li>The more Agile campaign configuration let the IBM team manage projects more effectively, and better regulate the workload</li></ul><h3>Cognitive Build</h3><p>The third IBM-wide ifundIT campaign took place as part of IBM Cognitive Build in the first quarter of 2016. This was our largest and most successful campaign to date, engaging more than 275,000 IBMers worldwide &ndash; over 8,600 teams came up with cognitive solution ideas, and 224,423 employees invested in 2,600+ of those ideas. As ifundIT continues to evolve and explore new aspects of enterprise crowdfunding, the campaign archetype changed once again during Cognitive Build, with the removal of funding goals in favor of ranking projects in order of most to least funded.</p><p>The key elements of this campaign were:</p><ul><li>Theme: all submitted projects had to have a focus on cognitive apps or functionality</li><li>Projects were ranked against each other in order of funding received, and the top 40 most funded were judged before a panel of executives for a chance to get funding for development</li></ul><ul><li>Investing took place over 10 days, and opened for all projects at the same time</li><li>There was an unlimited amount of investors, with $2000 awarded per investor</li><li>Each investor could contribute a maximum of $1000, or half of their allowance, to a single project</li></ul><p>Key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Since the campaign was TopX, there were no constraints around project submission numbers and costs, investor numbers, and investor fund allocations &ndash; the campaign had an unlimited number of participants</li><li>Encouraging videos to be part of project submissions made project pages more robust and helped teams pitch their ideas verbally/visually to the crowd</li></ul><h2>How it Works</h2><p>IBM ifundIT is more than just a business model. It&rsquo;s a concept: a new way of thinking about investing, innovating, engaging employees, and decision-making in a business environment. ifundIT consists of a set of interlocking parts, including a website, campaign modes, and a framework for managing a campaign throughout its lifecycle. Below, you will find a more comprehensive explanation of each of these elements.</p><h3>Setting Up an End-to-End ifundIT Campaign</h3><p>Unlike conventional public crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo, ifundIT uses targeted campaigns to meet the needs of enterprise organizations. These campaigns involve planning, infrastructure setup and hosting, and campaign management. Furthermore, each campaign moves through three phases: project submission, investing, and delivery. Each of these phases presents a unique set of decision-making opportunities, but the ifundIT team is available to provide support from the moment your organization decides to host a campaign until the final dollar is invested by the crowd.</p><h4>Planning</h4><p>Even the shortest campaign requires prior planning, strategizing, and configuration leading up to project submission and investment. The planning phase includes much of the overarching decision-making around the goals of the campaign, including the desired outcomes, budget, scale, focus, audience, and campaign mode. In addition, the Campaign Management Office (CMO) will develop its communications strategy during this phase, and begin to publicize the campaign throughout their intended audience.</p><p>The CMO should also take this time to establish a plan for the end of the campaign, specifically concerning next steps for successfully funded projects. It&rsquo;s important to develop a mature plan for the post-campaign phase, in order to ensure that the campaign delivers the maximum amount of viable ideas.</p><p>Throughout this period, the ifundIT team works with the organization&rsquo;s CMO to develop a campaign strategy, and gives recommendations based on the CMO&rsquo;s priorities and objectives.</p><h4>Infrastructure Setup and Hosting</h4><p>This phase covers the deployment of the organization&rsquo;s instance of the ifundIT tool, and the configuration of the tool by the CMO. This configuration contains two parts &ndash; any necessary branding customizations according to the communications strategy outlined during the Planning phase, as well as the specific campaign configurations regarding deadlines, project submission criteria, and investor and user authentication setup.</p><p>Throughout this period, the ifundIT team assists the organization&rsquo;s CMO with the technical setup of their ifundIT instance, and troubleshoots any difficulties or necessary adjustments to the tool.</p><h4>Campaign Management</h4><p>After the campaign officially opens and project submission begins, the CMO enters a period of ongoing campaign management. This is where the work of actually conducting the campaign truly begins, and where it becomes even more valuable to consider the three campaign phases.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Project Submission</strong></p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">Before any investing can occur, innovators need to develop and submit their ideas as projects. During this phase, the CMO should clearly communicate its desired outcomes to the innovators, and ensure that the projects being submitted fit into its vision for the Delivery phase. In addition, the Review Team evaluates submitted projects for viability, in preparation for the post-campaign development process. Once the CMO feels it has achieved a healthy pipeline of new ideas in the form of submitted projects, it opens up the ifundIT site to its investor pool, and investing begins.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Investing</strong></p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">During this phase of the campaign, we recommend that the CMO actively moves in the direction of its desired outcomes, through ongoing education and communications directed at investors as they choose which projects to invest in.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong>Delivery</strong></p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">Once investing has closed, the CMO moves ahead with funded projects as determined during the planning phase &ndash; in the form of development, a hackathon, presentations to venture capitalists, or some other end result. This phase represents not only the &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; of funded projects into these post-campaign channels, but also &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; of the desired campaign outcomes, ranging from new marketable innovations to increased employee engagement.</p><p>Throughout this period, the ifundIT team provides ongoing assistance to the organization&rsquo;s CMO, and continues to troubleshoot any emergent issues with the ifundIT tool. In addition, the IBM team consults with the CMO regarding next steps for funded projects and analyzing the results of the completed campaign.</p><h3>The ifundIT Tool</h3><p>The ifundIT tool is an independent and customizable instance of a templated website hosted for your organization by IBM. The tool represents both the face and the core of your crowdfunding campaign; both investors, innovators, and the rest of your audience will interact with projects and each other through the website. A variety of templated elements are included from the start, but the tool contains customization options under administrator access to allow your organization to modify everything from the banner of the landing page to the project submission wizard.</p><p>The site follows a social paradigm, in which members of your audience receive a profile that allows them to invest in and/or submit projects. Innovators create pages for their projects with images, descriptions of their project and goals, and updates after their project has been funded. Project pages track a project&rsquo;s progress towards a funding goal or current ranking, depending on the campaign model, and allow participants to leave comments. The site also allows users to follow projects they are interested in to receive notification of any updates, as well as &ldquo;like&rdquo; projects to show their support.</p><p>The ifundIT site allows investors to search projects by project status, category, business area, and country; it also provides the option to sort search results by funding progress, date, investors, volunteers, followers, comments, and likes.</p><p>For Campaign Administrators, the administrator control panel includes many of the micro-level configurations for the campaign, such as setting project expiration dates, defining deadlines for project submission, and managing automatic email alerts.</p><p>Currently, the ifundIT site is only available in English, though support for French is actively in the works, with Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese planned for the future.</p><h4>Metrics</h4><p>One of the most valuable products of an ifundIT campaign is the data it produces, especially when your objective is to engage employees and measure interest. ifundIT contains a diverse set of metrics within the tool to help you tap into this resource, ranging from overall site visits and investment levels to individual project likes.</p><p>When the campaign is finished, the CMO can export all of this data from the site to a CSV file for post campaign analytics and evaluation.</p><p>While these metrics are helpful for assessing the engagement of users and the social effectiveness of the campaign, they can also help the CMO make key campaign-related decisions.</p><p>Here are a few examples of some frequently requested metrics that we have found particularly useful.</p><p>- <strong>Funding Requested</strong> indicates the sum of the funding goals for all projects.</p><p>- <strong>Investment Demand</strong> indicates the sum of investments still required for the projects that are actively seeking funding.</p><p>- <strong>Funds Available</strong> indicates the sum of investment dollars which can still be spent by all investors; in other words, it represents the total amount of unspent funding.</p><p>- <strong>Funds Available vs. Investment Demand</strong> indicates whether there is enough money available in order to fund the projects still seeking funding. Think of it as a measure of the &ldquo;funding saturation&rdquo; in the campaign marketplace -- if there is not enough money to fund as many projects as you want, you may consider making available extra funding dollars to your investors.</p><h2>What ifundIT Isn&rsquo;t</h2><p>ifundIT is a powerful tool for fostering innovation, encouraging employee engagement, and driving transformation in your organization, but it isn&rsquo;t the answer to every problem. Having a clear understanding of what enterprise crowdfunding can&rsquo;t do will help you make realistic decisions about your own campaign, and communicate your desired outcomes more effectively to your organization.</p><p><strong>ifundIT is about funding &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just a voting system</strong></p><p>As an enterprise crowdfunding platform, ifundIT is powered by the concept of investing. It works because participants are able to attach a dollar value to their support, and because innovators understand that this support carries with it a promise of a return on investment. As you are considering whether or not ifundIT is a good fit for your needs, make sure that your organizational goals are aligned with the benefits of enterprise crowdfunding. If you just need some way to measure the opinion of the crowd or encourage bottom-up innovation, you might be better served by some form of idea jam or voting tool.</p><p><strong>IfundIT requires a serious commitment for success &ndash; it&rsquo;s not magic</strong></p><p>ifundIT has led to incredible transformations at an astounding scale within IBM in only a few years, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that it wasn&rsquo;t alone: each of our campaigns required considerable investments of work hours and funding to make them successful. ifundIT isn&rsquo;t alchemy &ndash; it can&rsquo;t just magically generate new ideas out of thin air. Rather, it leverages a resource that already exists within your organization &ndash; the crowd &ndash; to meet your needs.</p><p><strong>ifundIT is an idea generation platform &ndash; we don&rsquo;t just give you money </strong></p><p>Despite what the name might suggest, ifundIT is not a bank. If your organization decides to use ifundIT, you need to make sure you can secure enough funding to fully support it. In addition, be sure to clarify this same point to your innovators if you decide to run a campaign &ndash; once they understand that they&rsquo;re being trusted to invest their company&rsquo;s money, they will likely be much more excited to participate!</p><p><strong>The ifundIT PMO doesn&rsquo;t take over your funded projects &ndash; it&rsquo;s up to you to see them through</strong></p><p>ifundIT is a great way to increase innovation and develop solutions to existing problems in an unconventional way. However, ifundIT itself is not an end-to-end solution &ndash; in other words, we can&rsquo;t claim responsibility for what happens to funded projects after your campaign is finished. You can count on us to help you with setting up a campaign, and we&rsquo;d love to work with you to establish a pipeline to bring funded projects into the real world, but the onus is on you to ensure that you follow your campaign through to your desired outcomes.</p><h3>Campaign Modes</h3><p>ifundIT campaigns fit into two overarching modes: &ldquo;Fund2Goal,&rdquo; in which projects must raise funds up to a set goal in order to enter development, and &ldquo;TopX,&rdquo; in which projects compete to earn funds and &ldquo;place&rdquo; in the top ranking for further development.</p><p>Each of these campaign modes is highly configurable &ndash; you can adjust the timeline, funding goals, participant models, and campaign limiters in accordance with your organization&rsquo;s objectives and characteristics. However, each mode has its own benefits and challenges that make them suited for different business purposes.</p><p>Below you will find more detailed explanations of each of the two campaign modes &ndash; when considering which campaign will be best for your organization, look to &ldquo;Choosing a Campaign Mode&rdquo; (LINK HERE??)</p><h4>Fund2Goal</h4><p>The Fund2Goal mode is the closer of the two to a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; crowdfunding model. In a Fund2Goal campaign, innovators submit projects for investors to invest in, with a funding goal that is typically equivalent to the cost of developing the project, usually as a Proof of Concept. Investors are given a set amount of funds to invest in projects they feel passionate about, and the campaign ends once either the planned budget has been allocated to funded projects or a set deadline has been reached.</p><p>The budget of a Fund2Goal campaign is tied to the funding needed to develop successful projects. As such, the number of investors and the funds allocated to each investor need to be regulated. However, the correlation between &ldquo;ifundIT money&rdquo; and real development funding allows you to control the rate at which projects are funded.</p><h4>TopX</h4><p>The TopX mode is less dependent on the real-world funding set aside for the campaign, which makes it more flexible for a variety of use cases. In a TopX campaign, innovators submit projects for an unlimited number of potential investors, each of which has been given an amount of virtual funds. Rather than trying to reach a specific set funding goal, innovators compete against each other to rank within the top bracket in a set amount of time predetermined by the Campaign Owner.</p><p>The budget of a TopX campaign has no impact on the amount of money given to each investor, which permits any size of campaign regardless of how much investment each funded project receives. In effect, this mode grants nearly unlimited flexibility to your organization in terms of scale.</p><h2>Model Campaigns</h2><p>Here you&rsquo;ll find two model ifundIT campaigns, one for each of the campaign modes. For the purpose of the examples, assume that each campaign has the same budget, $300,000, and the same desired number of funded projects, 10. In addition, funded projects in each campaign receive the same amount of funding, at $30,000.</p><h3>A Model Fund2Goal Campaign</h3><ul><li>Project submission total (number of ideas submitted to campaign) = 100</li><li>Funded projects (number of ideas that get fully funded by crowd) = 10</li><li>Campaign investment budget (total amount to spend on campaign) = $300,000</li><li>Average funding target per project = $30,000</li><li>Investor allocation budget (total amount you put out to investor community) = $600,000</li><li>Funding allocation per investor = $2000</li><li>Number of investors = 300</li></ul><p>For a hypothetical Fund2Goal campaign with an investment budget of $300,000, the CMO would allocate in $600,000 in funds to investors, with each of the 300 investors receiving $2000 each. The average development, delivery and hosting cost per project of $30,000 would yield approximately 10 funded projects out of 100 project submissions.</p><h3>A Model TopX Campaign</h3><ul><li>Project submission total (number of ideas submitted to campaign) = undefined</li><li>Funded projects (top bracket of &ldquo;winning&rdquo; projects) = 10</li><li>Campaign investment budget (total amount to spend on campaign) = $300,000</li><li>&ldquo;Real&rdquo; funding awarded to funded projects: $30,000</li><li>Investor allocation budget (total amount you put out to investor community) = undefined</li><li>Funding allocation per investor = $2000</li><li>Number of investors = unlimited</li></ul><p>For a hypothetical TopX campaign, the numbers are a little less concrete. Because funded projects are decided by placement into the top bracket &ndash; 10, in this example &ndash; there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;floor&rdquo; submission total needed to guarantee the desired number of funded projects. In other words, if 11 projects are submitted, all but one are guaranteed to be funded. That being said, in our experience, a robust pipeline of submitted projects increases the likelihood that the top 10 projects will in turn be viable.</p><p>Because of this, each funded project doesn&rsquo;t actually receive the amount of funds it &ldquo;earns&rdquo; during the investment phase. Rather, they get a predetermined share of the campaign investment budget as defined by the CMO &ndash; in this case, $30,000. Furthermore, since projects are effectively competing for a place on a leaderboard and not a limited amount of investor interest, the number of investors allowed to participate is effectively unlimited.</p></div>
