IBM ifundIT harnesses the energy of public crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and reorients it for the enterprise context. It retains the crowd-sourced innovation of conventional crowdfunding, and engages users at all levels &ndash; employees, executives, and clients &ndash; but uses the power of enterprise capital and strategic capability to disrupt the corporate decision making process.</p><p><strong>ifundIT can help you&hellip;</strong></p><p><strong>Impact your business by turning ideas into products and value</strong></p><p>New ideas are the core of enterprise crowdfunding. With ifundIT, you can tap into the latent creative and problem-solving potential that already exists within your organization to generate real products, services, and solutions. ifundIT drives business value within your organization through social engagement, resulting in innovation, increased efficiency, and higher potential for growth.</p><p><strong>Boost morale by letting the people closest to the problem figure out how to solve it</strong></p><p>With ifundIT, employees in your organization become both innovators and critical decision makers. As part of &ldquo;the crowd,&rdquo; they know that they make meaningful investment decisions, and feel empowered to know that their voice is being heard. This morale boost motivates innovation and allows the best and brightest to take leadership.</p><p><strong>Create transparency by putting employees in the driver&rsquo;s seat</strong></p><p>By shifting the decision making power from the top down, ifundIT makes investment decisions transparent and breaks down the traditional barriers between management and employees. With the crowd prioritizing and making decisions, nobody is left in the dark, and everyone can feel invested in the outcome.</p><p><strong>Engage your workforce by getting everyone talking</strong></p><p>ifundIT draws on the strength of the crowd, and encourages social sharing and collaboration. Innovators and investors are all part of a single unified community, and the most successful ideas emerge when people work together. ifundIT provides a fertile environment for cross-disciplinary contact, and brings experts from all different fields together to think and create. Enterprise crowdfunding is buzzworthy, invigorating, and inherently social &ndash; and ifundIT can inject these qualities into your organization&rsquo;s culture.</p><h2 id="useCase" class="scrollspy">Use Cases for Enterprise Crowdfunding</h2><p>ifundIT was created within IBM&rsquo;s CIO to disrupt the conventional mode of decision making in IT spending &ndash; hence the &ldquo;IT&rdquo; in &ldquo;ifundIT.&rdquo; As recent campaigns have proven, enterprise crowdfunding is applicable across a wide variety of use cases beyond IT. We have identified three primary categories of use case: Building New Ideas, Maintaining Existing Portfolios, and Improving Existing Portfolios.</p><p><em>These are only a few potential use cases for ifundIT, and may not mesh with the goals your organization has in mind for a campaign. If that happens to be the case, not to worry! ifundIT is a flexible platform, and our team is more than happy to work with you to iron out the specifics of the campaign that will best fit your needs.</em></p><h3>Building New Ideas</h3><p>The classic public crowdfunding mode almost exclusively exists in this category, which focuses on generating new ideas, products, and services.&nbsp; A key difference with enterprise crowdfunding, however, is that investors don&rsquo;t just wait to hear back after a project they invested in has been funded; they can count on their organization to follow up and develop the project into the next phase, because they know the organization&rsquo;s funding is invested.</p><ul><li>New idea generation</li><li>New product/process development</li><li>Proof of concept/prototype creation</li></ul><h3>Maintaining Existing Portfolios</h3><p>In addition to new ideas, ifundIT can also be a vehicle for decision making and upkeep of existing products and services. While this requires a more targeted, narrowly focused setting, giving the crowd the ability to evaluate existing ideas can potentially generate just as much value as drawing on them for new ones.</p><ul><li>Product redesign</li><li>Product lifecycle support &ndash; deciding which existing products receive support or are sunset</li><li>Existing idea evaluation &ndash; using the crowd to evaluate pre-existing ideas</li></ul><h3>Improving Existing Portfolios</h3><p>ifundIT can both drive the creation of new ideas as well as accelerate the maintenance of existing ones. It can even do both at the same time &ndash; by using the power of the crowd to source new additions or improvements to the foundations of existing ideas. By improving on established projects, ifundIT can help your organization draw on the collective wisdom of its innovators and the people closest to the product/process, to while retaining tight control over the focus of that wisdom.</p><ul><li>New feature requests</li><li>Policy changes</li><li>Product/process simplification<span id="cke_bm_42E" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2 id="successfulProjects" class="scrollspy">Successful ifundIT Projects</h2><p>The ifundIT program has helped IBM boost employee engagement, drive cultural transformation, and disrupt conventional corporate decision-making. It&rsquo;s also generated some incredible projects that have resulted in new apps, and services that continue to grow and make an impact at IBM.</p><p>Here we&rsquo;ve highlighted some of the most successful projects that have come out of ifundIT campaigns. They represent quite a diverse slice of the total funded projects, but they all share a defining trait: the support of the crowd enabled them to overcome obstacles that would have prevented them from being adopted in a conventional business funding model.</p><h3>CoachMe</h3><p><img alt="" height="155" width="155" src="/uploads/versions/coachme-icon---x----240-240x---.jpeg" /></p><p>CoachMe is an easy-to-use website that connects IBMers willing to share expertise in their domain with IBMers in need of coaching support. Users can type a skill or topic into a search box, and find a list of coaches who have blocked off time in their schedules for coaching.</p><p>The CoachMe team submitted their idea to IBM ifundIT during the Mobile campaign back in 2014, with the hope of gaining the backing and budget needed to take the idea to development. Their project was funded, which gave it the financial support it needed to become a working mobile application for IBMers. Soon after, CoachMe moved to a website on IBM&rsquo;s Technology Adoption Program so all IBMers could benefit from using the tool. Today, it is replacing the Global Mentoring Program and is also partnering with several other corporate initiatives that help IBMers learn new skills and grow their professional development.</p><h3>ACE: Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation</h3><p><img alt="" height="155" width="155" src="/uploads/versions/ace-icon---x----155-155x---.png" /></p><p>ACE, which stands for Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation, is an internal feedback and evaluation platform that has supported IBM&rsquo;s recent Agile transformation. It allows IBMers to solicit from and provide feedback to managers, teammates, and colleagues at the touch of a button. Envisioned as part of IBM's global updated performance review process, ACE encourages an Agile process of continual self-reflection and improvement.</p><p>ACE began its relationship with ifundIT in 2015, during the Spring into Bluemix campaign. Since ACE was already available as a web app, the ACE team submitted a project for a mobile app they had been working on. Their project was funded through ifundIT, and as a result completed development of the app. Now, the entire platform &ndash; web and mobile app together &ndash; are part of IBM&rsquo;s global strategy for its review system.</p><h3>Call In</h3><p><img alt="" height="155" width="155" src="/uploads/versions/call-in-icon---x----155-155x---.jpeg" /></p><p>Call In is a mobile app that takes IBMers from calendar invite to conference call in seconds. The app syncs with the native calendar app on iOS and IBM Verse or IBM Traveler on Android to allow users to join conference calls on their mobile phones directly from a meeting invite or calendar event.</p><p>Call In came into the 2014 Mobile ifundIT campaign with an existing and functional mobile app, so their project focused on incorporating new features such as One Touch, context information, and Blue Pages participant links. Call In is now in use by IBMers all over the globe, who appreciate the simple, effective, quality-of-life improvement the app adds to their workflow.</p><h3>ParkUp</h3><p><img alt="" height="155" width="155" src="/uploads/versions/parkup-icon---x----155-155x---.jpeg" /></p><p>ParkUp is a mobile app that was developed by IBMers in Madrid facing a universal problem: finding parking. The IBM office in Madrid has reserved parking spots in a designated lot, but the lot frequently had spots go unused as employees traveled for business, vacation, or worked from home. To solve this problem, ParkUp provides users the ability to list their spots for others when they know they won&rsquo;t need them, allowing their colleagues to &ldquo;book&rdquo; them, maximizing parking potential and saving everyone time and money.</p><p>The ParkUp team took their idea to the 2014 Mobile ifundIT campaign, and met with resounding success. Following its implementation in Madrid, ParkUp won a Client Value Outstanding Technical Achievement Award in 2015. Since then the app has been adopted in Warsaw, Poland, with expansion in the works for the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. For IBM employees, to see if ParkUp can be implemented in your city, search for the ParkUp Community on w3 Connections.</p><h3>IBM Maps</h3><p><img alt="" height="155" width="155" src="/uploads/versions/ibm-maps-icon---x----512-512x---.jpeg" /></p><p>IBM Maps is one in a collection of three separate platforms called Map2Meetings, together with Mobile Site Serv/ Room Finder and Smart Conference Reservation &amp; Facilities Management. Maps in particular aims to help IBMers who travel to unfamiliar offices find the location of the office and navigate to their meeting room.</p><p>Each of the three components of Map2Meetings got its start during the 2014 Mobile campaign, and joined together during development. The unified platform has seen niche usage in Brazil, however, IBM Maps has a mobile app that is being used globally.</p><h3>Tech Support for Clients</h3><p><img alt="" height="155" width="155" src="/uploads/versions/tech-support-for-clients-icon---x----418-418x---.jpeg" /></p><p>Tech Support for Clients is a mobile app that lets IBM customers access technical support content and functions for all of their IBM products. It serves as a hub for viewing support documentation, customer support plans, warranty information, and if needed, for contacting IBM customer service representatives with geo-location assistance and click-to-call.</p><p>Tech Support for Clients was an original project submitted during the 2014 Mobile ifundIT campaign. It is externally available for both iOS and Android, and is a fully-featured client-facing solution in CIO&rsquo;s Technical Support strategy.</p></div>
