Enterprise crowdfunding produces immediate benefits by harnessing the untapped power of the crowd &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also a powerful tool to amplify your organization&rsquo;s strategic goals.</p><p>For example, in the 2015 &ldquo;Spring into Bluemix&rdquo; campaign, all submitted projects were required to run on IBM Bluemix, IBM&rsquo;s cloud-based mobile and web app development platform. In addition to over 50 successfully funded projects, the ifundIT campaign increased awareness of Bluemix in the external Top Coder community which IBM was using to help in building some of the projects. The campaign resulted in 770 new Bluemix users, helping IBM achieve its goal of one million subscribers by the end of the year.</p><p>As your team begins to outline your first campaign, think carefully about its focus, and your desired outcome. Consider your organization&rsquo;s long term objectives &ndash; things like new development tools, educational initiatives, or any other strategic goals &ndash; and think about how you might be able to incorporate them into your campaign. For example, the focus of IBM&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cognitive Build&rdquo; campaign was on "Cognitive": a key pillar of IBM's strategy. To that end, project submissions were required to incorporate Watson APIs, but also encouraged Agile and Design Thinking methodologies throughout the process. Cognitive Build not only resulted in concrete innovation with Watson, but also a company-wide introduction to Cognitive, giving everyone in the organization a deeper understanding of the concept.</p><h2 id="team" class="scrollspy">Building your Team</h2><p>Running a crowdfunding campaign requires a serious investment of time and energy, and a passionate and committed team to make sure it is successful. The ifundIT team has both facilitated and actively managed a number of successful campaigns within IBM &ndash; while we&rsquo;ve advised other organizations on running their own campaigns, we&rsquo;ve also run some of the biggest ones ourselves. Based on this experience, we&rsquo;ve distilled the responsibilities and requirements of managing an ifundIT campaign into four key roles, broken down below. All together, they make up the Campaign Management Office (CMO).</p><p><em>It&rsquo;s important to note that these roles are the roles we used within our own company, and as such may not reflect the goal or necessities of your organization. Feel free to adapt, combine, or subdivide these roles to match the scope and budget of your campaign. While each role is relatively distinct, there&rsquo;s also plenty of room for overlap!</em></p><h3>Campaign Owner</h3><p>The Campaign Owner typically makes the decision to run an ifundIT crowdfunding campaign in their business. They define the campaign focus and desired outcome, set the budget requirements, and develop the campaign timeline. In addition, the Campaign Owner coordinates between the Campaign Administrator(s) and the Community Manager to set the overall campaign strategy.</p><p>The Campaign Owner&rsquo;s responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Setting the campaign&rsquo;s budget</li><li>Choosing a focus for the campaign</li><li>Allocating personnel and funding</li><li>Determining the campaign&rsquo;s audience</li><li>Choosing a campaign mode</li><li>Developing a timeline for the campaign</li></ul><h3>Campaign Administrator(s)</h3><p>The Campaign Administrator(s) oversees the many logistical and day-to-day requirements of the campaign, including initiating and leading the triage process for new project submissions, as well as the specifics of configuring the ifundIT tool for their organization. They also construct and appoint the Review Team, which is responsible for assessing the feasibility of each submitted project.</p><p>The Campaign Administrator&rsquo;s responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Configuring the ifundIT tool for their organization</li><li>Interfacing with the ifundIT team for any consulting or needed support</li><li>Determining and collecting the metrics they need</li><li>Establishing the investor model</li><li>Appointing the members of the Review Team</li><li>Conducting basic checks on project submissions to ensure that they meet campaign guidelines and organizational policies</li></ul><p><em>In our experience managing previous campaigns, we've found that many organizations combine the roles of Campaign Owner and Campaign Administrator and designate a single individual to fulfill the responsibilities of both. While this approach can be effective for smaller campaigns, we recommend keeping the roles separate for campaigns that run longer than 6 weeks or have an audience of more than 10,000 people.</em></p><h3>Review Team Members</h3><p>The members of the Review Team are Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who perform a lightweight assessment of the viability of each new project. The Review Team ensures that project submissions do not duplicate existing work, meet any business or campaign guidelines, and are feasible within the established scope and scale of the campaign. Review Team Members do not rate projects based on their content or marketability, or decide if they are good or bad (that&rsquo;s the crowd&rsquo;s decision!) &ndash; rather, they are intended to streamline the flow of innovation and maximize the quantity of deliverable projects.</p><p>The Review Team member&rsquo;s responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Providing subject matter expertise to project owners</li><li>Participating in reviews of project submissions for feasibility and duplicate work</li><li>Facilitating a pipeline of healthy ideas</li></ul><h3>Community Manager</h3><p>The Community Manager is responsible for developing the communication strategy for the entire campaign, and for leading the initiative to inform and promote the campaign with the organization&rsquo;s intended audience. They design any personalized content for the organization&rsquo;s instance of ifundIT, ranging from automated system messages to FAQs to landing page greetings. The Community Manager also manages the social aspects of the campaign and its participants, in the form of any online communities associated with the campaign.</p><p>The Community Manager&rsquo;s responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Designing specialized user interface content for the ifundIT tool</li><li>Developing the overall communication strategy for the campaign</li><li>Promoting the campaign throughout the organization</li><li>Managing online communities related to the campaign</li></ul><h2 id="budget" class="scrollspy">Allocating your Budget</h2><p>Every ifundIT campaign needs a predetermined budget of funds to fuel the crowdfunding investment of projects and to support them as they enter development or implementation. You should consider not only how many funded projects you want at the end of the campaign, but also how many investors can participate, and how much each investor will receive.</p><p>As you make decisions about allocating a budget for your organization&rsquo;s campaign, you&rsquo;ll need to consider a few key elements.</p><p><strong>How many projects are you expecting to build?</strong></p><p>In our experience running campaigns, 10-15% of submitted projects are fully funded. Consider aiming for 5-20 funded projects for your first pilot campaign, to set a manageable scale for project submissions while your organization becomes familiar with ifundIT.</p><p><strong>How much will each project cost to build and support?</strong></p><p>The average project cost will vary depending on your expected outcomes, so you should consider the financial commitment you can make to each funded project carefully when allocating your budget. If you&rsquo;re only interested in proof of concept applications of each project, as was the case in the Spring into Bluemix campaign (LINK HERE), then this cost might be relatively low. On the other hand, if you are looking for complete, client-facing apps or services, you&rsquo;ll understandably need to make room for the increased production time in your budget.</p><p><strong>How many investors do you want to participate?</strong></p><p>ifundIT can accommodate campaigns ranging from only a handful of participants to hundreds of thousands of employees across an entire company. However, depending on the campaign mode you want to use, your budget might be a constraint. Consider how the scale of the campaign your organization wants, as well as its goals &ndash; are you looking to engage your entire organization, or just a small group of experts?</p><p><strong>How much funding do you want to allocate to each investor?</strong></p><p>Based on our experience, we generally recommend an allowance of $2000 per investor. As with everything else, this amount is more a best practice than a hard rule &ndash; we&rsquo;ve found that $2000 is just enough for investors to feel like they have spending power and that their decisions have weight, without flooding the market with too much funding. Of course, if you&rsquo;re running a TopX campaign, you can adjust this amount however you like, since the funding projects receive from investors is not tied to how much they actually get.</p><p><strong>For Fund2Goal campaigns, assume only 50% of the investor budget goes to funded projects</strong></p><p>One of the most important differences between public and enterprise crowdfunding is the fact that investors are bringing the company&rsquo;s money into a project, not their own. Because all of the funding available to be invested has to be allocated by the CMO beforehand, you need to account for the fact that some investors won&rsquo;t spend all or any of their money. In order to ensure that there&rsquo;s enough funding to go around to get the desired number of successful projects, assume that only half of the total amount you give to investors will be put towards projects. As a result, we recommend doubling your total investment budget to determine how much you put out to the investor community.</p><h2 id="choosingCampaign" class="scrollspy">Choosing a Campaign Mode</h2><p>When deciding which campaign mode is the best fit for your organization, consider your budget and how many people you want to participate. Also think about the outcomes you envision for your funded projects: are you looking for many, more modest ideas, or a handful of well-developed complex ones? Do you want to prioritize employee engagement and idea vetting over concrete deliverable innovation? Do you want innovators to collaborate and work together to refine their projects, or have them compete against one another for the most investor support?</p><p><em>It&rsquo;s important to note that these campaign modes are a product of our experiences with ifundIT, and represent formulations based on continued iteration of our practices and strategies. Your CMO can and should think about adjusting whichever mode you choose to better fit your needs, or even taking elements from each one to create your own.</em></p><h3>Fund2Goal: Empowering the Crowd to Make Investment Decisions</h3><p><strong>Fund2Goal</strong> campaigns traditionally have a direct relationship between the funding a project earns during the investing phase and the cost of building it &ndash; in other words, investors have direct control over &ldquo;real money&rdquo; that will actually go to projects they support. This particular aspect makes Fund2Goal campaigns good for fostering employee engagement and disrupting the traditional decision making process regarding spending in the business world. In essence, with a Fund2Goal campaign, the number of investors is dependent on the size of your budget &ndash; this means that these campaigns generally tend to be smaller in size and scope.</p><p>Fund2Goal gives you:</p><ul><li>A funding marketplace to manage</li><li>Investment that shows &ldquo;real&rdquo; funding that projects will receive</li><li>A list of projects that meet their funding goal vs. those that don&rsquo;t</li><li>Projects that don&rsquo;t directly compete against one another</li></ul><h3>TopX: Using the Crowd to Rank Projects</h3><p><strong>TopX </strong>campaigns typically require little to no marketplace management, since the budget for funding projects is not directly tied to the funds given to investors. In other words, there is no differentiation in need between projects in a TopX campaign, therefore, there&rsquo;s no need to regulate funding during the campaign. Because of this, TopX campaigns work best when you want the dollar amount on each funded project to be an indicator of investor support rather than a real dollar amount. In essence, with a TopX campaign, the number of participants is independent from the size of your budget &ndash; meaning they can be as big or small as you need.</p><p>TopX gives you:</p><ul><li>No differentiation in funding need between projects</li><li>Investment that shows investor support, not the real dollar amount that projects will receive</li><li>Crowd ranking of projects</li><li>Projects that directly compete to secure a spot in the winning bracket</li></ul><h2 id="timeline" class="scrollspy">Planning a Timeline</h2><p>ifundIT leverages enterprise crowdfunding through designated campaigns, in which investing occurs over a set period of time. This period can be as short as a single week, as was the case in Cognitive Build (LINK HERE) or as long as a few months, or even more. When planning out a timeline for your campaign, keep in mind that you can use this flexibility to your advantage. There are a few main factors to consider as you configure your campaign timeline: the duration, and whether you want your campaign to be <em>continuous</em> or <em>fixed-start.</em></p><p><strong>Duration</strong></p><p>One of the first decisions you will make concerns the duration of your campaign &ndash; this will play a large role in setting the scale of your campaign, which will in turn affect its&rsquo; outcomes. A shorter campaign of around a week or two creates a high-stakes environment more similar to a hackathon or idea jam, in which innovators feel a time pressure to get their idea out and in front of investors, who only have a limited time to decide who will get their support. A longer campaign gives innovators more time to develop their idea, and investors more time to thoughtfully consider how to invest.</p><p><strong>Continuous</strong></p><p>In addition to duration, you also need to consider the manner in which you accept project submissions. If you want to create a more traditional crowdfunding environment, you might elect to make your campaign <em>continuous.</em> Essentially, this means that your campaign will accept project submissions at any time, and that each project has until its expiration date to get funding. In our experience, this configuration seems more at home with a Fund2Goal campaign.</p><p><strong>Fixed-Start</strong></p><p>The alternative to a Continuous campaign is a <em>fixed-start </em>one, in which all projects must be submitted on the same date, and investors have a set amount of time to give funding to projects before investing closes. Historically, most of IBM&rsquo;s TopX campaigns have been fixed-start, though Fund2Goal campaigns can also be effective under this framework. Running a fixed-start campaign will allow you to strategize around project submission and investment happening all at once, which may be valuable to your organization, if you want to push ideas into the development pipeline faster.</p><h2 id="requirements" class="scrollspy">Setting Requirements</h2><p>After running several ifundIT campaigns across our entire organization, we&rsquo;ve learned that communicating a clear set of requirements to both innovators and investors is essential to ensure that all stakeholders get what they want out of the campaign. Here you&rsquo;ll find the most recent iteration of our requirements for campaign participants, as well as some information about the experiences that led to their creation.</p><h3>Requirements for Innovators</h3><p>We found varying levels of commitment from innovators during our first IBM wide campaign in 2014. Some innovators were extremely committed to sticking with their ideas from submission to user deployment, but many were not. We found that some people got their ideas funded and then expected us to take over development. Others participated during the development process, but would not be responsive when we asked them to take actions, such as reviewing designs or code. Our team ended up having to make decisions or take actions on behalf of the innovator because they weren&rsquo;t engaged and were holding up development and other projects.</p><p>Based on our experience, we implemented the following requirements for the Spring into Bluemix campaign in 2015:</p><ul><li><strong>Commit </strong>to the project implementation schedule, and promptly communicate schedule limitations or conflicts</li><li><strong>Be responsive</strong> and respect deadlines by answering questions, reviewing designs, and testing builds when expected</li><li><strong>Post project updates</strong> for your investors, followers, and volunteers on a regular basis</li><li><strong>Own your project</strong> and stay with it through the entire lifecycle. If you are unable to stay with the project, it is your responsibility to find someone to take on the work</li><li><strong>Promote</strong> your completed project to the community</li></ul><p>If you do not comply with these requirements during the life cycle of your project, you will lose your funding.</p><h3>Requirements for Investors</h3><p>During the first campaign, it was easy to get enough people to support an idea and get it funded quickly. But, was the crowd funding the &ldquo;right&rdquo; ideas for the business? We saw too many investors putting money down and then walking away, without remaining invested in the projects they funded with company money. We wanted to make sure people understood that they were dealing with real money, and to encourage people to be thoughtful in their spending.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our experience, we implemented the following investor requirements for the Spring into Bluemix campaign in 2015:</p><ul><li><strong>Invest</strong> in the projects that will really make a difference to your colleagues and the company</li><li><strong>Drive the consensus</strong> among the investor community on whether the app is a good idea or not</li><li><strong>Treat the money</strong> as if it were your own. Ask yourself: &ldquo;would I really put real money down on that app to get built? Would it make a difference to me as an investor?&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Spread your funding</strong> between multiple projects, and if you don&rsquo;t find projects that are worth investing in, don&rsquo;t spend the money</li><li><strong>Question the innovator.</strong> If you&rsquo;re not sure what value a project will bring, ask them for more information on how this will benefit the company</li><li><strong>Follow up with the innovator </strong>for status updates if their project gets funded. Ask them if you see early designs, how their schedule&rsquo;s looking, and show personal interest in their project &ndash; you gave them your investment, after all! You&rsquo;re putting real money down, which makes you a stakeholder in their project&rsquo;s success</li></ul><h2 id="spreadingWord" class="scrollspy">Spreading the Word</h2><p>Developing a coherent communication strategy for your campaign is a key step in ensuring its success. Because ifundIT thrives on social engagement, you&rsquo;ll need to explain, publicize, and market both the platform and your campaign throughout your organization, in order to build and maintain momentum with the people you want to engage.</p><p>Here are some best practices our team has developed throughout our internal campaigns for communicating about ifundIT.</p><p><strong>Communicate value: both for and of employees</strong></p><p>The key to good participation within your organization is to make it known that management values and supports the campaign. Hone in on the fact that ideas and investment decisions are the power source of ifundIT, and that the platform prioritizes what investors and innovators have to say. It also values when participants act in their own self-interest &ndash; persuade innovators to make the things they want to use, and investors to support solutions to their own problems.</p><p><strong>Clarify that ifundIT can fit into or transform their normal work</strong></p><p>Trying to find ways to fit ifundIT into their everyday routine can help your employees get more engaged. Try to target the entrepreneurs in the crowd: those who have small projects on the side or an idea for a solution that isn&rsquo;t as big a priority. Or, you can pitch ifundIT as a new way to approach their everyday work, giving them the opportunity to direct change in their organization. The more people feel like ifundIT is an exciting opportunity for experimentation and not mandatory, the more likely they will be to get passionate about your campaign.</p><p><strong>Personalize the ifundIT tool </strong></p><p>Take advantage of the customizable fields in the ifundIT tool to reflect your organization&rsquo;s branding and unique culture. You can also add custom FAQs and links to your own internal communities and platforms. Be sure to personalize the automated email alerts that are sent out to all participants. Developing a unified voice across your communications will help integrate ifundIT into your organization&rsquo;s culture.</p><p><strong>Help your innovators create compelling projects</strong></p><p>Communications doesn&rsquo;t stop at the campaign level; it&rsquo;s vital that the CMO disseminate best practices for successful projects to innovators. The ifundIT tool supports this through a share feature, but you should encourage your innovators to be creative and positive in seeking investor support. One example from IBM&rsquo;s history were the &ldquo;PitchIT&rdquo; calls of the Spring into Bluemix campaign, in which project owners presented their ideas in a 5-minute format to interested investors.</p><h2 id="wrappingUp" class="scrollspy">Wrapping Up</h2><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve built your team, configured your campaign, planned it all out, and spread the word throughout your organization about ifundIT, all that remains is to open the campaign and let enterprise crowdfunding do its work. After that, it&rsquo;s time for congratulations! You&rsquo;ve hopefully seen how incredible the will of the crowd can be, and emerged with a handful of successful projects, an engaged workforce, and a more transparent decision-making process.</p><p>However, the work doesn&rsquo;t stop there &ndash; there&rsquo;s still much to be done to make sure your campaign continues to produce value long after it officially ends.</p><p><strong>Move funded projects towards delivery</strong></p><p>The most important step following a completed campaign is to work together with your innovators on next steps for their projects. This could take the form of getting them ready to start development, or another round of review to refine their idea. Ideally, your CMO will have laid the groundwork for this phase as it was planning and communicating your campaign to your organization. Once your successful ideas are built and delivered, make sure that you&rsquo;ve defined a path for long-term support and adoption.</p><p><strong>Reflect on and analyze your results</strong></p><p>ifundIT campaigns are tremendous sources of data about your organization, and can be a valuable decision-making tool after your campaign. Be sure to export campaign data from the ifundIT tool once investing is finished, and take the opportunity to read out on what went well, what didn&rsquo;t, and what your organization is going to do to achieve your desired outcomes post-campaign.</p><p><strong>Celebrate success</strong></p><p>Running an ifundIT campaign is a lot of hard work for everyone involved &ndash; make sure to celebrate your success! Highlight successful projects and innovators, and spotlight them in communications throughout your organization. Get the word out about the campaign itself, as well: ifundIT really is a new way to work, and it&rsquo;s an excellent example of how pushing decision-making power down the ladder can be transformative.</p></div>
